Project Description 

 

Our group has come to an agreement to start a mock organization which is called ‘Payung Hijau’. ‘Payung Hijau’ is a non-profit organization which aims to recover the areas that have been logged or deforested across our beloved country Malaysia. Our project revolves around the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) where we focus on the 15th goal: Life On Land. We plan to create awareness on how much flora and fauna that we have destroyed for the sake of infrastructure development, urban sprawl and agriculture. Information on deforestation without any step of conservation and pollution that occur without surveyance will be spread with our social medias as a medium pasted on the website. The website will also give way for people especially the Malaysian community to donate, volunteer and distribute the knowledge on our beloved forests that lands in our country. This project aims on saving what is left in our country in a small scale, and our planet in a bigger scale. It all starts from us. 

 

Our website consists of six main pages:  Home, About Us, Join Us, Donation, Projects, and Socials. We have chosen one main font to be used which is Poppins. The whole concept for this website is minimalist. Our pages are straight-to-the-point with its objective (respective to each page) is stated clearly and could be understood easily for uncomplicated navigations. Our backgrounds are calming yet soothing wallpapers of healthy forests and efforts made by our teams. Therefore, the elements in our website will play around the theme tallying the background that is white, green, and brown making it pleasant on the eye. 

 

For the organization flow, we put our objectives upfront. As our objective suggest, we highlighted the amount of funds that we have collected thus far in our homepage to signify the importance of the webpage, that is to earn donations from the community. Our description, “A place to fund energy and money for the greater good” indicates that the community can come here to donate funds, or volunteer themselves for our ambitions. In the ‘About Us’ page is a detailed description of our organization, what we do, what we need and what we gain from our hustle. 

 

The ‘Join Us’ and ‘Donation’ pages are quite similar in a sense. Both pages will pop-up a form to be filled in. Those who wants to volunteer can fill their details and our team will handle their posting based on their address while those who wants to donate just needs to pick an amount, and they will be re-directed to their preferred way of payment. Lastly our ‘Projects’ and ‘Socials’ pages both provide information on our current projects and media socials to raise awareness amongst the community of Malaysia.
